import-local.js: Hacked up MediaTomb import js which cleans up torrent
filenames and re-paths files for personal convenience.  Diff it against the
upstream import.js to see what changed.

mediatomb-ceac13-transcoder: Hacked up version of a transcoding script I found
elsewhere on the net.  This is used on a HP N54L Microserver.  Should be cleaned
up once subtitles are fully working.

config.xml: MediaTomb config.xml which uses the custom import and transcode
scripts from above.

launch_vuze.sh: Script to launch Vuze in an isolated network namespace which
can only reach the Internet via an I2P router and the Orchid plugin.  This
should prevent any leakage of the real IP address to swarms or the outside
world in general.  Note that aside from I2P DHT, your torrents will only be
able to use HTTP and HTTPS trackers (which are scraped via Tor).  You can get
an up-to-date list here: https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist
In this config Vuze is controlled via connecting to a virtual X server.
